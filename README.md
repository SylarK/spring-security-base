# SSB - Spring-Security-Base

This repository provides a foundational setup for projects that explore and implement core features of Spring Security. It serves as a practical guide for configuring various authentication mechanisms, with separate branches dedicated to each feature. The goal is to give developers a quick starting point for learning and implementing security features using Spring Security.

## Project Structure

Each feature is developed in its own branch to allow isolated testing and exploration. This structure enables you to switch between different security implementations and configurations without affecting other branches.
