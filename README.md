## X.509 Certificate-Based Authentication

This branch demonstrates how to configure X.509 certificate-based authentication using Spring Security. X.509 certificates are commonly used for client authentication, adding an extra layer of security by validating a certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

### Overview

X.509 authentication requires clients to present a valid certificate during the SSL handshake. Spring Security verifies the certificate, and if itâ€™s trusted, grants access to the requested resources. This approach is useful in enterprise environments where client authenticity is paramount for example.
